This current project will be a very basic recipe page, consisting of a main page that will link to several recipes.  

In this project I'll be showing what I have learned from my lessons so far, which I assume will include seeting up an html document and it's boiler plate, having mutliple elements inside the body of the html doc, and then showcasing links and one would assume: images.  

Strap in, and enjoy.
